Between a flight to the sky of Geneva or a deep dive in the fresh water of Lake Leman, this project examines the impact of digital technologies on the evolution of Geneva’s biosphere. Using 3D modeling tools and animation techniques, we will imagine the digital skies and lakes of tomorrow, revealing the species, living ecosystems, and the unknown objects that will inhabit them. Between fictional, dreamlike and speculative interpretations, results of the project will be a collection of 3D animations or 3D visuals.

This workshop is part of our ongoing investigation of carving new roles for designers in the ecological crisis. How can we engage citizens into understanding the state of our planet? What types of original formats can we invent to tell stories about our environment?

## Béatrice Gorelli, Colliding Corpuses

The short film is an abstraction of the relationship between humans and water in the context of geographical boundaries. It introduces the paradoxical theme of the division of the waters between Switzerland and France on Lake Léman.

"This is a wall dancing between the waters. A paradox that resides in our minds
a weak and thin boundary. Stubborn men who draw cold borders on paper. Nature has been resilient to us. Nature got tired."

## Hypoxia, Chloé Michel

Hypoxia is the medical term referring to a lower-than-normal concentration of oxygen in tissue, which can lead to anoxia, a complete absence of oxygen and thus to death. As human artificializes Lac Léman to adapt it to its activities, wether it is by cutting it’s underwater vegetation so swimmers can enjoy a clear water or using the water as a medium to heat the cities, it disturbs the natural oxygenation of the lake, necessary to the survival of its ecosystem.Hypoxia takes the form of a tryptic in which the lake, taking human form, suspended in water and in time, is being asphyxiated by a plastic-like material.

## L'envers, Manon Waneukem 

CONTROL. NEED. POWER. Nature is no longer natural. Only appearances remain. This project uses poetical 3D visuals to explore the conflict between nature and artificial artefacts. It interrogates our need to control and to claim things as our own.

## The Lake, Alexandre Moura Ferreira & Paul Bellon-Serre

The Lake is a short film that mixes 3D animations and filmed images. It immerses the viewer on a cruise on Lake Geneva. The waters are populated by fantastic creatures from the waste that live at the bottom of the Lake. As we go on the cruise, we discover a half-organic, half-plastic ecosystem that developed in the lake abyss. The soundtrack of the film is an excerpt from the poem Le Lac d'Alphonse by Lamartine, performed by Pol Plançon.

## Mission 26, Maÿlis D'Haultfoeuille & Lison Christe

Mission 26 is the project of two renowned scientists from the Canadian-based scientific research group for the aquatic environment; the CSRGAE. After a short study on the shores of Lake Geneva, Maÿlis D'Haultfoeuille and Lison Christe were able to observe that this well known lake still raises many questions. In particular on the nature of its bottom. Historically, Mrs Piccard, father and son already tried to probe the depths, but the results remained very foggy. This was all it took for the two scientists to embark on a poignant adventure in search of the real shape of Lake Geneva and to discover its previously unknown overflowing flora and fauna.

## Shoes are \<not\> for SALE, Simone Di Mauro & Alejandra Oros 

In Geneva, only 37% of the shorelines are publicly accessible. Despite the fact that, according to the Swiss civil code and the L.A.T. (Loi sur l'aménagement du territoire.), the public shouldbe able to have access to all lake and river shorelines. The reality is that Lake Leman, cannot be “walked” around by all citizens as the law said. In most cases, the path prescribed by law ended in front of the plots of wealthy landowners, cutting therefore a big part of a path that used to belong to all. The Lake, who had been the inspiration for many artists, and poets, including Mary Shelley’s masterpiece: “The Frankestein”, had become a place that only a few could enjoy. We decided then to do a set of images to show the privatization of Lake Leman, from different perspectives,taking as main protagonists the artifacts and traces of human’s attempt to conquer and own,not only the land around the lake, but the lake itself.

## Staggering Dive, Thibaud Goiffon

A slow descent into dark foggy waters, something unsettling seems hidden... Light passes through strange bodies revealing their presence. You touch the bottom as the last light glimmers fade.

## Dentritogenèse, Maxime Maugin 

What if we rethink the practice of 3D tools by giving them new parameters: dreams, water and the matter of digital synthesis. The aims is to intiate a research work in art, aiming to reflect on the tool and uses of digital synthesis, without being encumbered with a dubious globality. Indeed, the starting postulate is deliberately specific and arbitrary. The method consists of analyzing the materiality of each of these parameters to extract properties. This work will be achieved through the creation of various tools useful for the development of this new practice.
